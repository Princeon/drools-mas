        <para>
            Github.com project repository: 
            <ulink url="https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools-mas">https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools-mas</ulink>
                
        </para>
        <para>
            Get the source code (you need to have git installed in your computer):
        </para>
        <code>
            git clone https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools-mas
        </code>
        <para>    
            In order to compile, test and install the project you should run:
        </para>
        <code>
            mvn clean install
        </code>
        <para>    
            Look at the archetypes section to see some examples about how to create your own agents.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Examples</title>
        <para>
            Take a look at the examples directory to find out a very simple agent and a client that test
            the agent functionality. The example provided witht the project was created using the archetypes projects:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>drools-mas-agent-web-archetype</listitem>
                <listitem>drools-mas-client-side-app-archetype</listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            
            Right now the example provided is called Emergency Agent, and it's composed by three different modules:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>drools-mas-emergency-agent-model</listitem>
                <listitem>drools-mas-emergency-agent</listitem>
                <listitem>drools-mas-emergency-agent-client</listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            The Model project contains all the domain classes that will be shared by the agent and its clients. 
            The Client project contains a simple test that demonstrate how to contact the agent from your client applications. 
            It will also include a test about how you application can be contacted by the agent in the case that its required by 
            the business scenario. This example is analyzed more in depth in the Emergency Agent section of this documentation.
