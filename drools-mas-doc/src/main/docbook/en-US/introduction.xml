        <title>What is an Intelligent Agent?</title>
        
        <para>
                There is no standarized defintion for what an Intelligent Agent is, so for the sake of this document an agent
                is a piece of software that is designed to act and communicate with other entities based on its internal goals, state and 
                knowledge.
                
                These intelligent agents by design will keep an internal state that will be used by the agent to decide what to do next 
                or how to answer request from other agents.

        <title>Multi-Agent Systems</title>
        <para>
            When we have multiple agents interacting in the same ecosystem we need an infrastructure to enable all the interactions.
            For this reason a set of global components will be provided to build this ecosystem that will enable rich interactions.

        <title>Drools MAS</title>
        <para>
            Drools MAS aims to provide the common infrastructure and set of tools to create the individual agents and 
            the ecosystem required for their interactions. The first half of this document is focused on how to design, build and
            use individual agents. The second half will be focused on how to use the different components provided to build an
            scalable infrastructure to host these agents (work in progress).
