    <title>Drools MAS - ACL </title>
    
       
    <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            This module covers the implementation of the ACL languange and the current implementation inside  the Drools MAS project. 
            This language defines the messages (performatives) that will be interchanged by the agents. 
            
            These performatives represent communication acts and the FIPA-ACL standard defines the semantic for each of these acts. The Drools MAS ACL
            Module is incrementally supporting all these performtives. For more information about the formal definition of the semantic proposed by the
            FIPA-ACL standard you can take a look at the following link: 
            <ulink href="http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00037/SC00037J.html#_Toc26729686">http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00037/SC00037J.html#_Toc26729686</ulink>
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The Drools MAS project started defining the implementation details for the following performatives:
            
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>Inform</listitem>
                <listitem>Inform-if</listitem>
                <listitem>Inform-ref</listitem>
                <listitem>Query-if</listitem>
                <listitem>Query-ref</listitem>
                <listitem>Request</listitem>
                <listitem>Request-if</listitem>
                <listitem>Request-ref</listitem>
                <listitem>Request-when</listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            All the performative structures are available inside the ACL module, but the core is not supporting them all at the moment.
            We will be updating this list as long as we support more performatives. The following section describe each performative semantic
            according to the FIPA-ACL standard specification. A test (called SemanticACLTest) inside the core module checks that this semantic is respected by the implementation.
            
            The following section analyze quickly the semantic for the Inform, Rquest and Query-if and Query-ref performatives to give you
            an idea about how they are intended to work.

        <title>ACL Performatives</title>
        
        <para>
            The <code>Inform</code> performative is used to notify the receiver that a given proposition is true. We will use 
            this performative to send new information to the agent. It's to the specific agent implementation to decide what
            to do with the information provided as a proposition inside the ACL Inform Message. This message is represented by 
            the Inform class, located inside the drools-mas-acl module. This <code>Inform</code> class contains a <code>proposition</code> attribute of type <code>Info</code>
            that will be the one in charge of hosting the information about the propositon.
