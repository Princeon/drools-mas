    <title>Drools MAS - Generic Client - Dialog Helper </title>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            This module is a very simple utility module which contains a helper and a set of common client classes which will 
            allow us to interact with another agent. The main idea behind this module is to provide a ver simple JAR file 
            which quickly allow us to interact with an agent. You will see that the Archetype for creating agent clients is 
            using this module as dependency, because it contains the Dialog Helper, which is explained in the following section.

        <title>Dialogue Helper</title>
        <para>
            This utility class is a key to start interacting with an external agent. We can easily create a new instance of this class
            by doing:
        </para>
        <programlisting>DialogueHelper helper = new DialogueHelper(endpoint);</programlisting>
        <para>
            Notice that we will need to know the endpoint of the agent that we are trying to contact. This dialogue helper 
            will provide us a set of utility methods to create different performatives with just one single line, and then
            obtain the answers from the remote agent.
        </para>
        <para>
            Internally the DialogueHelper will use the ACLMessageFactory from the Drools MAS Util project to build the different
            performatives structures.
        </para>
        <para>
            Right now the helper provides the following methods:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            public String invokeRequest(String sender, String receiver, String methodName, LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; args)
            public void invokeQueryIf(String sender, String receiver, Object proposition)
            public void invokeInform(String sender, String receiver, Object proposition)
            public List&lt;ACLMessage&gt; getAgentAnswers(String msgId)
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            In future releases it will support helpers for all the performatives providing an only entry point to interact with all
            your deployed agents.
            The current implementation uses the Async Endpoint exposed by the agents, meaning that the DialogueHelper will not 
            block until the agents send the responses back. For that reason the getAgentAnswers() method provides you a way
            to get all the answers for an specific message id. We as client applications will need to call that method until we receive
            some answers and check if those are the answers that we are expecting. It will be responsibility of the client application/agent
            to decide what to do if the agent doesn't respond as we are expecting.
