            In order to be able to use the Drools Grid infrastructre you will need to set up and start different Grid Nodes
            in different JVMs if your scenario requires it. This section of the documentation will help you to set up your
            environment and configure the agents accordingly. This section will also describe the Yellow Pages component
            inside grid which will be used to register our agents. We will be able to use this Yellow Pages component in order
            to locate where our agents are and how we can contact them.

        <title>White Pages Database</title>
    
        <para>
            Drools Grid will use a centralized place to store where all the Grid Nodes are located. In order to find them when
            they are needed, each time that we start a new grid node it will automatically register itself into the white pages.
            If you take a look at the Agent's archetypes you will find that a database is being setted up and required in order
            to run the agents. When we have an environment where more than one agent is required we will need to set up a 
            common database for both agents, so they can find each other and interact. 
            
            When we have just one agent, we can use an embeded database to enable the agent to work. The Dev(Development) and Prod(Production)
            Maven profiles that are defined inside the agents contains the parameters that will be used by the agents at start up to 
            initialize the database. If the database is correctly initialized, the internal Grid Nodes used by the agents will be 
            automatically registered inside the generated tables.

        <title>Create and Start a new Grid Node</title>
    
        <para>
           A Drools Grid Node represents a different JVM instance which can host multiple Knowledge Sessions that can be accessed
           remotely. This mechanism is being used by Drools MAS in order to be able to distributed the internal sessions of 
           an agent into different machines.
